# Image-Compression-Algorithms
This repository contains my take on various existing image compression standards while also tracking my progress to develop a proprietary 
algorithm for the CCSDS Image compression standard to transmit HS data being captured by a CubeSat.

JPEG Encoder contains HDL descriptions of * *you guessed it* * a JPEG Encoder. I'm yet to synthesize and tabulate the perfomance of it on any FPGA. Done as part of a SOP under S. Harshavardhan in 6th Semester, BITS Pilani
